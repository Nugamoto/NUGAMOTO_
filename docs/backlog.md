# Backlog

## MCP Integration Follow-ups
- [ ] Extend `backend/core/config.py` with MCP-specific settings:
  - `MCP_MANIFEST_URL`
  - `MCP_CLIENT_ID`
  - `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- [ ] Wire new settings into authentication and client bootstrap code.
- [ ] Document MCP deployment steps once configuration is implemented.
